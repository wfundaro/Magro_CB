Engine Game using Allegro 5 (Code::Blocks)

A little game engine using Allegro 5 https://liballeg.org/
Idea during a gamejam to save time in my next gamejam.

I left the minimum files to use the allegro library.
For the release build you can use lib and dll files depending on your project.

I used allegro-i686-w64-mingw32-gcc-7.2.0-posix-dwarf-static-5.2.4.1.zip
